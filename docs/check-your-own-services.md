# Check your own services

0. Log on to your organization's ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise portal
0. For one of the layer items in the portal find the answers to the following questions:
    0. What type of item is it?
    0. What is its item ID?
    0. What is the REST endpoint URL of the service for this item?
    0. Is this service a Map Service, a Feature Service, or something else?
    0. If it is a Map Service running on an ArcGIS Server site, open Server Manager and determine if it's cached or dynamic.
    0. If it is a non-hosted Feature Layer, what user-managed data store does it reference?
0. Repeat for other layer items as time (and your patience) allow
